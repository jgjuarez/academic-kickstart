summary: An Autocidal Gravid Ovitrap intervention used to control mosquitoes in South Texas.
abstract: "Control programs targeting Aedes species have had little progress in preventing disease transmission of dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Even more, they have shown limited effects on reducing the natural populations of Aedes species. In some cases, the efficiency of an intervention may rely on the percentage of community participation when novel control tools are deployed in an area. We evaluated two methods of community recruitment with a target of 80% community participation, in low- and middle-income communities in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas. Our first approach was based on traditional methods of community recruitment as a vector control program, with the use of a general flyer and house to house recruitment. The second approach was based on community engagement and outreach, with the use of community developed flyers, community meetings, weekend mosquito outreach, house to house recruitment, and a Knowledge, Attitude and Practices survey. We present the results of how these efforts are integrated into the evaluation of an Autocidal Gravid Ovitrap intervention for the control of Aedes aegypti in South Texas. The work is intended to guide community engagement tools and procedures that may be used by local public health officials for future surveillance and control efforts along the US-Mexico border. "
