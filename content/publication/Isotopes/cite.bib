    abstract = "{The use of stable isotope enrichment to mark mosquitoes has provided a tool to study the biology of vector species. In this study, we evaluated isotopic marking of Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) in a laboratory setting. We determined the optimal dosage for marking adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes with 13C and 15N. Additionally, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were single and dually marked with 13C and 15N for up to 60 d postemergence without changes to adult body size or transgenerational marking. This report adds to the growing literature that explores the use of alternative marking methods for ecological and vector biology studies.}",
