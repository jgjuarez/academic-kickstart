    abstract = {Author summary Despite the success of the Chagas disease vector control program in Guatemala, there are still regions with persistent T. dimidiata infestation. The municipality of Comapa, Jutiapa, is one of such areas. After several rounds of residual insecticide sprayings, infestation of some communities remained >15%. We evaluated the impact of a decade of vector control activities through three cross-sectional seroprevalence and entomological surveys (1999 through 2015). We found that transmission to children has decreased ten-fold. However, new infections persist in women and children. To reach the Chagas disease elimination goal, integrated vector control strategies should include community-wide insecticide applications, education to change exposure to risk factors and increased access to diagnostics and treatment for women and children.},
