My name is Jose Guillermo Juarez (a. k. a. Willy) and I’m a PhD candidate of the Department of Entomology at Texas A&M University. I have a true love for learning novel methods of vector control and community participation/engagement for developing Integrated Vector Control Interventions (that’s my passion). There is a need for novel methods of vector control that can effectively protect communities at the highest risk of vector borne disease transmission. These methods will require in-depth understanding of the social, biological and ecological factors that modulate how vectors interact with human populations. At the same time these eco-bio-social factors will help us develop culturally acceptable methods of control that might be tailored for our local communities. 

I have worked on insect vector control programs for diseases such as Chagas, Dengue and Malaria. I have also worked evaluating RNAi targets for different insect vectors and irradiation procedures for the Sterile Insect Technique for *Aedes* sp. I joined Dr. Hamer’s lab at Texas A&M to work on an Eco-Bio-Social approach for the surveillance and control of *Aedes aegypti* in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas.
